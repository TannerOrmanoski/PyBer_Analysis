# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to create a graph for the total weekly fares for each of the city types in the data set. With this graph, we then examined the differences between the fares in each city type and determined how these differences might be used by decision makers at PyBer.

## Results

After examining the graph and data frames, created in this project, it is obvious that there are some key differences in the data for the urban, suburban, and rural city types. A look at the pyber_summary_df DataFrame outlines these differences.

The rural city type has substantially less rides, drivers and total fares compared to the other two city types. The average fare per ride and driver are, however, larger than the urban and suburban city types. Moving along to the suburban city type, we see more rides, drivers, and total fares, but a slightly less average fare per ride and driver. The pattern continues with the urban city type, which has the most rides, drivers, and total fares, but the least average fare per ride and driver. When looking at the line graph of total fares by city type, we see the previously mentioned differences in total fares reflected. The only other information to be gleaned from this graph is that the urban city type experiences more volatility in the total fare amount than the rural or suburban city types.

## Summary

With this information, we can pose a few different suggestions to PyBer. The most obvious suggestion would be for PyBer to market more to the rural area. With the average fare amounts being so high, there is more room to expand this market. Another suggestion is to convince some of the drivers in the urban areas to start giving rides in the suburban and rural areas. The total drivers outnumber the total rides in the urban area, which means that this area is oversaturated with drivers. This causes the average fare per driver to be rather low. In the rural and suburban areas, the rides outnumber the drivers, so more drivers could be accommodated in these areas. A final suggestion would be to adjust the fare amounts according to demand. When there is a surplus of demand, raise the fare, and if the demand is low, lower the fare. With the fare being adjusted to fit the demand, the volatility should decrease.
